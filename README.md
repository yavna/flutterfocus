As students, studying for multiple exams can be overwhelming, especially when you still have other coursework and commitments which is why we wanted to create a platform that would help you create a plan and stick to it.
## What it does
Have an upcoming exam? By inputting the exam date, the exam name, and how many hours you want to study a day, you can get a personalized study plan, and a study buddy that grows as you study!
We built the face of our platform using React, so we styled the page with CSS and constructed our elements with JavaScript XML. Behind the scenes, we utilize Gemini to generate customized study plans and process them into different formats that are easier to work with.
